/*
    -> to run this js file, you can simply run the following command :
        node file_name.js
*/

// process.stdout.write("Hello world\n");
console.log("Hello world");


/*  
    So if you run the two lines (6, 7) you see something diffrent on command line,
    so we see that process.stdout.write will print the string as she write just 
    caracters, so we understand the console.log() is bunch of function alot of things
    works to show us the output !
